## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1: Starting with "Hello, World"

Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs because of its simplicity and significance. At the time, even writing a simple program
to print "Hello, World" or my name felt challenging and intimidating as a beginner. Looking back now, it’s amazing to
see how far I’ve come what once seemed overwhelming is now one of the easiest tasks in programming. This lab represents
the foundation of my journey in computer science and serves as a reminder that even the most complex problems start with
learning the basics.

Lab 4: Overcoming Challenges Alone

Lab 4 holds a special place for me because it was the first time I truly had to solve problems on my own. Normally,
I would rely on my partner or wait for help when I encountered issues, especially with formatting and debugging.
On this particular day, I couldn’t attend class, so I had no choice but to tackle the lab by myself. Using a mix of AI,
YouTube tutorials, and the professor’s tips, I managed to solve the problems that initially seemed insurmountable.
This experience taught me the value of persistence and resourcefulness, making it a pivotal moment in my learning.

Lab 12: Exploring Complexity with Animated Images

Lab 12 is my third favorite lab because of how challenging yet rewarding it was. The task of creating animated images
felt daunting, but it gave me a glimpse into the complexity and creativity of programming. While it was one of the most
difficult labs, it helped me realize how important it is to tackle advanced concepts and see the bigger picture.
This lab not only expanded my understanding of coding but also boosted my confidence in facing more complex projects
in the future.
